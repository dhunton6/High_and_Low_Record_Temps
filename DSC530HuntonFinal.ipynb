    "# Record-Setting Temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "In talking with people about global warming (which I prefer to call Chaos Weather, as it seems more accurate to me), they often point out record cold temperatures as a sign against climate change. Ignoring the question of whether an increase in record low winter temperatures would prove or disprove climate change, I decided to explore whether there truly are more records being set now than a century ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided that there were a number of different kinds of records which might work for my research:\n",
    "- High temperatures\n",
    "- Low temperatures\n",
    "- High precipitation (taking into account both rain and snow)\n",
    "- Droughts\n",
    "- High pressure readings\n",
    "- Low pressure readings\n",
    "- Wind speeds (maximum gust and/or maximum sustained)\n",
    "- Storms (tornadoes and hurricanes)\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first began to research, I found a NOAA data source (C00781) that showed weather record temperatures, which I believed would save me a lot of time that I could use in locating additional data. However, in attempting to download this database, I was informed that it is not actually a database, but instead a piece of software on their server that finds whether a record was set on a particular day. There is no digital file available.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading and starting to process temperature files from NOAA (processed and summarized on kaggle), I discovered that each year's data file contained 1-40 million lines of data. I had originally intended to analyze 20 years (as well as additional types of data) from each decade, but computing and time constraints has limited that to 5 years (and only temperature data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the size of the files, I will attach my file processing code in a separate .py file so it doesn't freeze up your computer as you read this summary. In that function, I read in the data from all of the daily data lines, save and process the info needed:\n",
    "- Mean high temperatures\n",
    "    - Also separated by hemisphere\n",
    "- Mean low temperatures\n",
    "    - Also separated by hemisphere\n",
    "- Record high temperatures\n",
    "    - Also separated by hemisphere\n",
    "- Record low temperatures\n",
    "    - Also separated by hemisphere\n",
    "\n",
    "And since I have the data loaded (and don't want to load it all again), I also separate out the data needed for pmf and cdf charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for analyzing data is to load the packages that will be needed."
